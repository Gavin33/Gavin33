My name is Gavin Butler, and I am an animation teacher changing careers to my dream job of being a fullstack web developer. I use my experience with animation, art and design to help bring my clients' vision for their website to life. I have previously worked with a small business owner in co-designing a demo website for her company (https://muvabeautybardemo.web.app). Contact me today for more information.
